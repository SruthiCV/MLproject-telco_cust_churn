# MLproject-telco_cust_churn
This is a classification problem project that I worked on to predict Telco Customer Churn

The objective of this project is to
1. Create a data model to predict whether a telco customer will churn or not using various attributes
2. Identify the relationship between predictive variables and the target variable.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/home

Analysing all relevant customer data helps in the prediction of behaviour to retain customers and to develop focused customer retention programs. For the dataset, each row represents a customer, and each column contains attributes of customers.

The dataset contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features), and includes information about:
• Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn and the variable ‘Churn’ is our target variable 
• Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies 
• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges 
• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Churn in the telecom industry is inevitable, and expensive. The costly effects of churn, however, can be minimized through understanding the factors that lead to customer attrition, identifying customers likely to churn, and proactively offering them discounts that would reduce the likelihood of them leaving.
